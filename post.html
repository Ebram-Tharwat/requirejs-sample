<h1>Getting Modular with JavaScript</h1>

<p>The role of JavaScript for application development has seen a serious uptick over the past few years.
    Just a few years ago, we would use JavaScript for client-side form validation and some AJAX and UI
    tricks using Prototype and Scriptaculous. Even more sophisticated started to pop up, like Dojo, ExtJS
    and the JQuery / JQuery UI combo. It became possible to create feature-rich applications with near-desktop
    fidelity, all using JavaScript in the browser.</p>

    <p>With that growth though, JavaScript started to creak at the seams with some of the limitations of the language.
    Douglas Crockford's "JavaScript: the Good Parts" provided a thoughtful guide for how to avoid the dangerous
    areas of the language, but there are some constructs present in languages like Java, C++ and C# that have to
    be improvised in JavaScript.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest areas has been in modular program. JavaScript, while extremely powerful even with it's
    simplicity, has no default notion of namespaces or module loading. This is the sort of modularity addressed
    by the <code>package</code> keyword in Java or <code>namespace</code> in C# or C++. Various libraries have
    created their own workarounds to this code modularity issue, but there isn't anything native in the current
    ECMAScript specification to address this.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, out of this vacuum, two strong frameworks have emerged. For server-side work, NodeJS
    embraced the CommonJS standard. For client-side work, AMD, as implemented in RequireJS, has emerged
    as a rallying point for writing modular code.</p>

    <p>Making effective use of RequireJS requires a mindset shift of developers. In the "good" old days,
    a developer would successively load a series of JavaScript files through the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
    This was simple enough for a few files, but it quickly turns in to a maintenance nightmare in a
    JavaScript-heavy application. Without a clear way to define modules, JavaScript code can quickly become
    convoluted and difficult to maintain. Loading multiple JavaScript files via the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
    tag can also drag down application performance as the user has to wait for the scripts to load to interact
    with the application.</p>

    <p>RequireJS brings sanity to this situation. It provides not only a clear definition for what is a module,
    but it also provides the mechanism to load the modules asynchronously. This improves code maintainability
    and also performance by allowing a page to only load the modules it needs.</p>

    <p>The key concept with RequireJS and AMD is the module. A module is simply a JavaScript function that returns
    a value. That value is typically another function or a JavaScript object. For example, a simple module that
    defines a way to convert a String to uppercase would look like this:</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
define(function() {
    return function(s) { return s.toUpperCase(); };
});
</pre>

    <p>The <code>define</code> function is created by the RequireJS library and allows the definition of a module.
    Convention is to use the name of the file as the name of the module, so if I save this snippet as <code>upper.js</code>
    I could make use of this module like this:</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
require(['upper'],function(upper) {
    console.log( upper('hello world') );
});
</pre>

    <p>In this case, I use the <code>require</code> method so specify some code I want to execute, along with its
    dependencies, which is the "upper" module created above. RequireJS express
    this relationship by having the first parameter to the <code>require</code> call be an array of the modules a
    new module depends on. RequireJS will deal with loading the dependencies and will pass each dependency, in order,
    to the function that is the module definition. The parameter name is arbitrary, but convention is to use the
    name of the module.</p>

    <p>This is a pretty basic example to demonstrate what a module is. Now I'll put some more rubber to the road and
    show a complete picture. The code for this is up on my
    <a href="https://github.com/timsporcic/requirejs-sample">GitHub account</a>, so you can grab it for yourself.</p>

    <p>This example uses RequireJS, Twitter Bootstrap, doT and some RequireJS plugins to create a simple page
    that generates a table via doT templates and a modal dialog to edit the row when clicked on. I'm just using
    a JSON file as the datasource, so there is no updating, but that eliminates the need for a backend in the example.</p>

    <p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of the <code>index.html</code> setups up RequireJS and the Bootstrap CSS file.
    Note the <code>data-main</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that loads RequireJS. This
    specifies the overall application-level JavaScript file used by RequireJS. In this case, it means to
    look for a file called main.js under the <code>scripts</code> directory.</p>

<pre lang="html" line="1">
&lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8">
    &lt;title>RequireJS Sample&lt;/title>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/bootstrap.css">
    &lt;script src="scripts/require-jquery.js" data-main="scripts/main">&lt;/script>
&lt;/head>
</pre>
